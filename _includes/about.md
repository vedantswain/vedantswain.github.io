I'm Vedant Das Swain, a [Distinguished Research Fellow](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/research/postdoctoral-fellowship/) in Human-Computer Interaction and Personal Health Informatics at Northeastern University. I am interested in improving workers' understandings of themselves by leveraging methods at the intersection of ubiquitous computing and computational social science.

Humans interact with technologies in many ways that are impreceptible to them. Since, computers and computing have begun to engulf people's reality, they provide a unique perspective to understand human behavior. In my research, I investigate applications of technologies embedded in everyday life as passive ---unobtrusive, continuous, and automatic--- sources of behavioral data. One facet of my research studies the ecological validity of passive sensing applications for analyzing human dynamics and informing interventions for wellbeing. A complementary facet of my research is to study the societal adoption of these passive sensing by critically inquiring how the data is generated, modelled, and situated among stakeholders. In particular, I investigate approaches to improve the future of work and campus life. My research has been published at top-tier computer science venues like CHI, CSCW, UbiComp/IMWUT, ACII, and IEEE CogMI. My publication at CHI 2022 won a Best Paper Honorable Mention award. I have also received individual awards, namely the Gaetano Borriello Outstanding Student Award at UbiComp 2022 and the GVU Foley Scholar Award. My research has been supported by IARPA, NSF, CDC, ORNL, and Semiconductor Research Corporation. I have also collaborated with Microsoft Research to make near-term impact in the fast-changing future of work.

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was co-advised by [Prof. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) and [Prof. Gregory D. Abowd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/abowd-gregory/). 
I completed my M.S. in Human Computer Interaction from Georgia Tech and my B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering from IIIT-Delhi.
